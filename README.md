// Initialize with your Web3 provider and contract address
const web3Provider = 'YOUR_WEB3_PROVIDER_URL';
const contractAddress = 'CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
const realEstateInvestment = new RealEstateInvestment(web3Provider, contractAddress);

// Example: Investor invests in a property
const amount = 1000; // Investment amount in Ether
const propertyId = 'PROPERTY_ID';
realEstateInvestment.invest(amount, propertyId)
    .then(() => console.log('Investment successful'))
    .catch(error => console.error('Investment failed:', error));

const investmentId = 'INVESTMENT_ID';
realEstateInvestment.withdrawInvestment(investmentId)
